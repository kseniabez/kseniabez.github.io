      <h3>1. Idea</h3>
      <p>
        During my exchange semester in Sweden, I've had the chance to explore a lot. One of the highlights was a trip to Kiruna, which is inside the Arctic Circle. One of my dreams since childhood was to see the Northern Lights. That was one of the main reasons I decided to go on that trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I went there, and I saw them. It was one of the coolest things I’ve ever experienced. Below you can see some pictures my friends and I took.
      </p>

      <p>
        And this is basically how I came up with the idea for a project. I want to replicate something beautiful.

      <h3>2. Specification and Plan</h3>
      <p>
        After getting a rough idea of what I wanted to achieve, I began outlining a plan for implementing the Aurora simulation. It quickly became clear that the task was more complex than I initially anticipated.
      </p>
      <p>
        I realized that, in order to replicate the Northern Lights, there were two main challenges: first, creating the shape and movement of the aurora, and second, designing an appealing way to shade and render it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While preparing the project specification for my course coordinator, I recognized that tackling both of these aspects simultaneously might be too ambitious and difficult for the scope of the course. As a result, I decided to narrow my focus to the animation of the aurora itself, leaving the shading for later. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope to later enhance the simulation by integrating existing shaders to improve the visual appeal. For now, I'll prioritize perfecting the fluid simulation and the movement of the aurora, and will revisit the shading aspect once the core simulation is solid.

      <h3>3. 2D Fluid Simulation</h3>
<p>
  I just finished building the 2D fluid solver that will drive the aurora simulation. 
  It's based on two incredibly helpful guides — <em>Fluid Simulation for Dummies</em> by Mike Ash and 
  <em>Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games</em> by Jos Stam. These resources were essential for implementing the core fluid dynamics.
</p>
<p>
  The solver produces beautifully soft, cloudy motion — exactly the effect I'm aiming for the auroras. 
  The next step is to guide the flow so it mimics how the aurora naturally moves across the sky.
</p>
<p>
  Here's a preview of what it looks like in action. The green coloring was added for aesthetic purposes, 
  and I think it really helps to visualize what the final simulation might look like.

  <h3>4. Aurora Motion - Spiral Simulation Phases</h3>
  <p>
    After setting up the fluid simulation, I moved on to the core of the project: shaping how the aurora moves. 
    This involved designing the velocity fields, guiding the flow to mimic patterns observed in real aurora.
  </p>
  <p>
    Drawing from T.J. Hallinan's theoretical model, auroral spirals emerge through a sequence of four distinct phases: 
    the formation of an aligned arc, the onset of undulatory instability causing the arc to fold, and the formation of a structured spiral array. 
    These transitions are driven by evolving field-aligned currents and ionospheric feedback, capturing the influence of magnetospheric dynamics 
    on auroral structure.
  </p>

      (Adapted from T.J. Hallinan, <em>Auroral Spirals 2. Theory</em>, J. Geophys. Res., 1981.)
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    In my simulation, I emulate this progression by gradually transforming the velocity field across phases.
    While the transformation is currently driven by mathematical approximations using geometric patterns, 
    it captures the essence of auroral evolution and provides a flexible framework for future refinement.
