      <h3>1. Idea</h3>
      <p>
        During my exchange semester in Sweden, I've had the chance to explore a lot. One of the highlights was a trip to Kiruna, which is inside the Arctic Circle. One of my dreams since childhood was to see the Northern Lights. That was one of the main reasons I decided to go on that trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I went there, and I saw them. It was one of the coolest things I’ve ever experienced. Below you can see some pictures my friends and I took.
      </p>

      <p>
        And this is basically how I came up with the idea for a project. I want to replicate something beautiful.

      <h3>2. The Plan</h3>
      <p>
        After getting a rough idea of what I wanted to achieve, I began outlining a plan for implementing the Aurora simulation. It quickly became clear that the task was more complex than I initially anticipated.
      </p>
      <p>
        I realized that, in order to replicate the Northern Lights, there were two main challenges: first, creating the shape and movement of the aurora, and second, designing an appealing way to shade and render it. 
        While preparing the project specification for my course coordinator, I recognized that tackling both of these aspects simultaneously might be too ambitious and difficult for the scope of the course.
        As a result, I decided to narrow my focus to the animation of the aurora itself, leaving the shading for later. I hope to later enhance the simulation by integrating existing shaders to improve the visual appeal. 
        For now, I'll prioritize perfecting the fluid simulation and the movement of the aurora, and will revisit the shading aspect once the core simulation is solid.

  <h3>3. Aurora Dynamics - Folds and Spirals</h3>
  <p>When working on the aurora animation, I discovered that auroras come in various shapes and sizes. To better understand how they form and what influences their shape, I did some research.</p>

  </div>
  <p style="font-size: 0.9em; text-align: center; margin: auto;">
    Examples of different types of auroras from the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018JA025274">Oslo Aurora THEMIS (OATH) dataset (2018)</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I learned more about how auroras work, I realized that their dynamics are quite complex. 
    As a result, I decided to focus on the visual aspect rather than an exact physical representation.
    But I still wanted to incorporate some physics into the animation.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my research on the different types of auroras, I was particularly intrigued by auroral folds, curls, and spirals.
    At first, I simply liked how beautiful they looked. But later I also found that they could be roughly described using
    the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI)—a phenomenon commonly seen in liquids and fluids! It actually can also occur in plasma
    and influence the nother lights.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was a happy accident! As it turns out that my idea of animating auroras using fluid dynamics had some scientific basis behind it.
  </p>
  <p>
    T.J. Hallinan actually described a theoretical model of the formation auroral spirals. Below is a figure on how the auroral curtain is
    shaped by currents going into separate directions and with some circular petrubations cause a fold and then a spiral to appear.

  <h3>4. Implementing Fluid Dynamics</h3>
  <p>
    As I said in the previous post I decided to implement the auroral folds and curls using Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. As a base for my
    simulation I decided to use Euler fluid equations. I debated using Navier-Strokes equations method, which are considered more physically
    accurate. But then decided not to, since my simulation is not aiming for percise physical accuracy, rather on an interpratation.
  </p>
  <p>
    And with a solid plan and math in hands I turned to coding. These tutorials were extremely useful and helped me not get stuck:

        How to write an Eulerian fluid simulator with 200 lines of code</a> by Ten Minutes Physics on YouTube.
  </p>
  <p>
    A few errors and bug fixes later, I got my first auroral fold spiral animation. I was extremely happy by the result, because it was the first
    time I was able to see something roughly similar:

  <p>
    Next I decided to try to simulate not just one fold, but a longer sheet.
